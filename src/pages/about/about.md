chat.horse is a fan project for the brony community. It aims to provide
communication tools for private conversations without the ability for a
third-party company to be able to pry into what you're saying. It also
provides features like custom emotes and never asks for money in return. This
site is free forever.

The chat component is built on top of [Matrix](https://matrix.org), which can
be a bit confusing to understand sometimes. chat.horse strives to make it
easy as possible to use, but fundamentally it is a paradigm shift in terms of
messaging - far away from the traditional big-company to many-users design,
and as such there can be a little bit of a learning curve.

What makes Matrix cool is that anyone can set up a service like chat.horse,
and their users can seamlessly talk to ours. The people behind Matrix are
also [incredibly open about its development](https://matrix.org/blog/), even
opening up [the source code](https://github.com/matrix-org), so there's no
danger of them suddenly turning evil and locking us out of features/services.

Matrix has its concept of "bridges" as well, which is what allows us to
seamlessly [talk to Discord and Telegram users](/bridging). There's bridges
to more services than just these as well, [here's an incomplete
list](https://matrix.org/bridges). We'll set up more if necessary.

Above all this project is just a thank-you project to the brony community,
which has substantially improved my life in more ways than I can count. I
hope you enjoy using it as much as I did building it.

Enjoy!
